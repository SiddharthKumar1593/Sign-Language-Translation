# Sign Language Transformers (CVPR'20)

This code is based on [Joey NMT](https://github.com/joeynmt/joeynmt) but modified to realize joint continuous sign language recognition and translation. For text-to-text translation experiments, you can use the original Joey NMT framework.
 
## Requirements
* Download the feature files using the `data/download.sh` script.

* [Optional] Create a conda or python virtual environment.

* Install required packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

  `python -m signjoey train configs/sign.yaml` 

! Note that the default data directory is `./data`. If you download them to somewhere else, you need to update the `data_path` parameters in your config file.   
## ToDo:

- [X] *Initial code release.*
- [X] *Release image features for Phoenix2014T.*
- [ ] Share extensive qualitative and quantitative results & config files to generate them.
- [ ] (Nice to have) - Guide to set up conda environment and docker image.
